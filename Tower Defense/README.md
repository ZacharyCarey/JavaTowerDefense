# Java Tower Defense
This is a project that I started back in high school when I was learning how to code Java, which was probably my first "real" programming language besides LUA.
It's pretty outdated at this point when I found the project in college digging through some old files. Since I know how to use git now, I figured I give the project a permanent home online so I will never lose it and can revisit whenever I please for nostalgia's sake.

## Dependencies
The engine uses LWJGL2 for graphics and some 3rd party library "slick-util" which i'm pretty sure just does some matrix math to make things easy.
